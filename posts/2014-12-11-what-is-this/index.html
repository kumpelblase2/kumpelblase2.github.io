				<p>This is, as you might've noticed, something that looks like a blog, doesn't it? Well, it is indeed some form of blog, but don't expect it to have (continuously) new content on it. I tend to forget such things pretty easily and then I found something new and get rid of the old stuff&hellip; Which might be somewhat sad but I just like to try out all the new things.</p>
<p>So what do I do in my daily life? And what would I put here? Um, nothing and everything seems like a bad but fitting answer. I kind of want to write more just to get better and used to it, so I might just rant about something that doesn't make any sense to just feel like having done something. I might also just put up some results I found when working with some kind of framework that I tried out. Or you might even find a solution to an issue you have with X application that, for whatever reason, I also have and fixed. So basically, I don't know what I, in the end, will put up here. I honestly don't expect someone to read anything that I push up here, either because it is completely boring or generally badly written.</p>
<p>When you have come this far, you are either actually interested or everything else is even more boring than this (which I would find pretty unusual), so why don't I tell you something about myself? I'm currently in university on my way to a bachelors degree in applied computer science. I also work in this field for the rest of the time at a company here in Germany. Been generally interested in programming and computers as soon as I had my first own computer. It's not like I ripped that thing apart as soon as I got it to see what kind of cool parts it had, but lets say I started slow. As probably every boy in my age (I'm 19 right now), I also tend to play video games every now and then.</p>
<p>That's enough around me for the time being I think. More will probably shine through when I actually write things on this blog thingy.</p>
