Actually, it's almost exactly five years since I made the first post. So is it just a coincidence that I just now thought about writing again?

I'm (still) in university, though I finished my bachelors, worked for a few years and now just started my masters degree. I still hang around in the same chatrooms and do small projects here and there that I think would make my life better. I also still like <a href=https://i.imgur.com/cPgFt5W.mp4>gifs</a> <a href=https://i.imgur.com/3P3nEOh.mp4>of</a> <a href=https://i.imgur.com/myYc3r9.mp4>cute</a> <a href=https://i.imgur.com/GLiAwVM.mp4>animals</a> and specifically <a href=https://i.imgur.com/CVsYUNQ.jpg>red</a> <a href=https://i.imgur.com/ANsdnaH.jpg>pandas</a>.</p><p>However, there have been quite some drastic changes if you look a bit deeper. For one, I finally moved out and got my own four walls to live in. While this is mostly due to me studying in a far away city, it's still a change I've been looking forward to. This is one of the bigger changes and one of the most recent ones. While it does feel a bit lonely at times, having no one around also forces me to not be lazy and actually deal with stuff myself. Even though it has only been several weeks, it's already shown progress which makes me happy.</p><p>I also remember writing about how <a href=https://blog.eternalwings.de/posts/2015-03-27-the-only-reason-i-cant-love-linux/>I can't like linux</a> yet here I am, using linux full time for over 3 years and I wouldn't want it any other way. But if you asked me if I would still want a program such as little snitch on linux I would definitely say yes. Similar changes happened in my choice of phone OS though with less success. Went to Android for a generation only to go right back after the phone had hardware issues. Anyway, linux has been serving me exceptionally well, specifically having a rolling release distribution makes it much more pleasant than having to do a full system upgrade every now and then which may or may not brick your system. Given that macOS had its fair share of upgrade issues in recent years and windows 10 doesn't even let you manually do updates on your own accord, it certainly is a breath of fresh air to be in full control of your updates. Speaking of full control - being able to chose a more minimal desktop environment or even going with just a window manager has been a great experience, although I'm thinking about going back every other month. The customizability and the lack of &ldquo;features&rdquo; just make it worth for me. Given the fact that Steam does contain a big library of games that work natively on linux as well as their ongoing work on proton makes playing games on linux a possibility too.</p><p>I've started playing around with <a href=https://twitter.com/kumpelblase2/status/1146870118879809536>3d printing</a> though because of the move I borked the printer a little and need to get it fixed first before continuing. My love for mechanical keyboards, especially clicky ones, grew in recent time. I experimented a bit using a split keyboard which sadly didn't work out so far (but I won't toss the idea!). Currently in love with the RGB One keyboards from <a href=https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en>ducky</a> and hope they'll last me for years to come.</p><p>To finish off, I've done some projects over the years that I should mention. <a href=https://github.com/kumpelblase2/proxtop>Proxtop</a> would probably be the biggest one which is sadly falling off the wagon when it comes to time sadly. As most projects, it started a project to make my life easier and hopefully made some other lives easier too. But because I'm watching less and less anime, the need wasn't there anymore and thus my enthusiasm for continuing to work on it. Another bigger project has been <a href=https://github.com/kumpelblase2/vima/>Vima</a>, which solves my need to organize <em>many</em> videos in a nice way. I've been working on a successor to fix some issues with the design of it, but it's not quite there yet, which is why the development has stagnated. Most recently, I started <a href=https://github.com/kumpelblase2/seeker>Seeker</a> to make finding new streams on twitch easier. While it's only very recent, it works pretty well already I'd say.</p><p>There's a lot more that I haven't covered but I'm pretty happy with where I am right now. Excited to see what the next years have in store for me.</p></div><hr class=post-end><footer class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>782 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2019/12/11 16:28 +0000</p></footer></article><div class="post-nav thin"><a class=prev-post href=https://blog.eternalwings.de/posts/2015-03-27-the-only-reason-i-cant-love-linux/><span class=post-nav-label>Older&nbsp;<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-right"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"/><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"/></svg></span><br><span>The only reason I can't love linux</span></a></div><div id=comments class=thin></div></main><footer id=site-footer class="section-inner thin animated fadeIn faster"><p>&copy; 2019 <a href=https://blog.eternalwings.de/>Tim Hagemann</a> &#183; <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank rel=noopener>CC BY-NC 4.0</a></p><p>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Hugo</a> &#183; Theme <a href=https://github.com/Track3/hermit target=_blank rel=noopener>Hermit</a> &#183; <a href=https://blog.eternalwings.de/posts/index.xml target=_blank title=rss><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-rss"><path d="M4 11a9 9 0 019 9"/><path d="M4 4a16 16 0 0116 16"/><circle cx="5" cy="19" r="1"/></svg></a></p></footer><script src=https://blog.eternalwings.de/js/bundle.min.4a9a0ac3d2217822c7865b4161e6c2a71de1d70492264337755427898dd718f6.js integrity="sha256-SpoKw9IheCLHhltBYebCpx3h1wSSJkM3dVQniY3XGPY=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
