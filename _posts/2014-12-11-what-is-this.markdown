This is, as you might've noticed, something that looks like a blog, doesn't it? Well, it is indeed some form of blog, but don't expect it to have (continuously) new content on it. I tend to forget such things pretty easily and then I found something new and get rid of the old stuff... Which might be somewhat sad but I just like to try out all the new things.

So what do I do in my daily life? And what would I put here? Um, nothing and everything seems like a bad but fitting answer. I kind of want to write more just to get better and used to it, so I might just rant about something that doesn't make any sense to just feel like having done something. I might also just put up some results I found when working with some kind of framework that I tried out. Or you might even find a solution to an issue you have with X application that, for whatever reason, I also have and fixed. So basically, I don't know what I, in the end, will put up here. I honestly don't expect someone to read anything that I push up here, either because it is completely boring or generally badly written.

When you have come this far, you are either actually interested or everything else is even more boring than this (which I would find pretty unusual), so why don't I tell you something about myself? I'm currently in university on my way to a bachelors degree in applied computer science. I also work in this field for the rest of the time at a company here in Germany. Been generally interested in programming and computers as soon as I had my first own computer. It's not like I ripped that thing apart as soon as I got it to see what kind of cool parts it had, but lets say I started slow. As probably every boy in my age (I'm 19 right now), I also tend to play video games every now and then. 

That's enough around me for the time being I think. More will probably shine through when I actually write things on this blog thingy.
