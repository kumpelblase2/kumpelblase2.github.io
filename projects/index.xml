      <description>Live Version
Seeker is a project I started recently which should help people find new streams on Twitch.
The Idea While Twitch does have a page to browse for the streams with currently the most viewers to find new streams, I found that page to be rather inadequate for that purpose. The reason is that for most people (including me) when they&#39;re searching for new stuff to watch, they don&#39;t reall know exactly what they&#39;re looking for.</description>

      <description>I have a big collection of videos that aren&#39;t movies or series (educational videos for example) which I&#39;d like to organize so I can search for specific ones, track progress or make notes. Sadly, the only kind of software that is in this space are &amp;ldquo;Media Servers&amp;rdquo;. I say &amp;ldquo;sadly&amp;rdquo; because those media servers are made for movies and tv shows where there&#39;s public metadata available that a server can provide in addition to streaming the video itself.</description>
