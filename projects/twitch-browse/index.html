Seeker is a project I started recently which should help people find new streams on Twitch.
The Idea While Twitch does have a page to browse for the streams with currently the most viewers to find new streams, I found that page to be rather inadequate for that purpose. The reason is that for most people (including me) when they’re searching for new stuff to watch, they don’t reall know exactly what they’re looking for. Instead, I know what I’m not looking for. For example, you can see this in the British parlament when they’re talking about Brexit. Jokes aside, I think this is a general problem that doesn’t only apply to finding a new streamer, but for any case where you have a lot of choices without any clear constraints (another example might be window shopping). You could go on and look through the whole page of streams, but why wouldn’t Twitch allow you to remove certain streams that you know you won’t watch?"><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2019-11-28T00:00:00+00:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2019-11-28T00:00:00+00:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="355"><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.eternalwings.de/projects/twitch-browse/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Re: boot"><meta property="og:title" content="Seeker"><meta property="og:description" content="Live Version
