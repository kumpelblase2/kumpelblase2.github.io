After all, I just wanted to learn Rust. However, I would obviously be happier the more features the emulator ends up having. Additionally, the more basic features were already documented really well. The whole launcher with its interactions, the login and character select were essentially completely document when it came to the network interaction.

From here on out it’s just the fun of working on something that does not exist outside. But there’s a lot more things that trip me up now that I’m in uncharted terretory. I’m spending a lot more time on research given most packets beyond the charselect are not documented or are otherwise outdated. The client is also very unhappy about malformed packets. Reverse engineering not being my best skill also makes working with the client on other levels troubling.
