To lay the foundation making the later parts understandable, this introduction provides the basics of the network protocol used in Silkroad Online. None of this is really new information and is simply compiled to provide a self contained explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When designing a (network) protocol, there are a few things you want to strive for. One of the being avoiding ambiguity and another being consistency. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a packet to be parsed differently, depending on the time of day. Or if you want to represent a concept, like a list of something, to be encoded in several different ways. This makes it significantly easier to parse and work with as it allows for a single, simple parsing pass and better reuse of code across different areas. In the following I want to look closer that the protocol used by &lt;a href="https://www.joymax.com/SilKRoaD/">Silkroad Online&lt;/a>, but first lets go over some basics.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
