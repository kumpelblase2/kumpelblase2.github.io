				<title>I Just Feel Like Writing About This</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The title doesn’t really give anything away about the content, so what is it about? So I watched a TED talk the other day from Susan Cain, “The power of introverts”, and she also touches the topic about introverts in school. I just want to give my experience on this topic, not about introverts in school, but in university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would consider myself an introvert right now, however, when I was younger I wasn’t as introverted as I currently am. This was especially true in the first years of my secondary education, however, it started to shift as soon as I got into programming. Earlier, I was completely fine working in bigger groups and that pretty often. It wasn’t too common in school, but it happened every now and then. So it was all nice and dandy until that point. But what changed when I got into programming?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started, I began with creating simple HTML pages (I know, this is not considered programming…), which felt like programming for me at the time (which was around the age of 13~14) and I had fun doing so. No one really helped me and I just tried things out by myself and educated myself. This isn’t a big accomplishment on it’s own and I certainly don’t feel like it is. It’s just like every other first step into a certain direction. But it wasn’t just a first step of learning programming, it was also a first step into knowing how to teach myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about school? I was still in secondary education so shouldn’t school be the one “teaching” me? The thing is, programming is not considered “general knowledge” here as of right now (I would at least take some ideas from it and integrate it into the curriculum somewhere, but that’s another story). It’s not what everybody needs to know to a big extend and it’s just me who’s having a bigger interest. Wait a minute, though. Not everyone will have interest in programming, I get that, but they certinaly will have interest in something else that is also not tought in school which might result in their job or something that they will really need in their later life. Again, that would also be too specific for the content of what the school is teaching. However, the process of learning something that you’re interested in without someone helping you is a good and needed experience. Why? You certainly don’t need this skill in school do you? Not really no, because that’s not what school is about (it just teaches you the basic knowledge to understand other things). But everything that comes after that is relying on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump a bit forward in time, I’m in my first semester of studying applied computer science. Been continuing to look more into programming throught the time in between. Trying out new languages to see new concepts, doing small projects to get some experience and read up on best practices and whatnot. Also, if you do a lot of programming, you will sometimes get into the position to learn more about the OS, memory and generally how things work in computer, so I had some knowledge of those things too. Because of all of this, the first semester was pretty easy, for me at least. I either already knew what the professors were talking about or would have something in mind that’s similar to the problem they proposed (like OOP, binary system, logic, etc.). When I looked around at the other students, I could see several other people who are doing as great as I did, if not even better. But I also saw some people struggling. Not that they didn’t like computer science, they just struggled learning or understanding the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I looked at what they did to solve this -well- issue. I couldn’t help but notice that most of them were relying on others, or more to the point, relying on the help of others. I mean, not an occassional small question when they really weren’t able to figure it out, but actually relied on others to help them understand it several times. Some people might consider this as standard group learning, but I don’t really feel the appeal of that. The problem is that this doesn’t work in the long run as there won’t always be people around you helping you get those things into your brain. The problem feels like they never really learned “how” to learn without someone else, who understood it, telling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why did I focus so much on the fact that I’m an introvert and introverts in general in the beginning? The thing is, since I, as an introvert, never really felt like I want to stay in groups for a long time, I was more often than not put in a situation where I was forced to figure out things on my own. This is the point where you start to train yourself how to learn new things. Sure, this might take time, but given I stayed alone many times, this wasn’t too big of an issue. As I’ve mentioned, by the time I came to university, I already teached myself most of the things we did in the first semester(s). This already helps in the lecture itself, how to sort the new information raining onto you, and these things most of the other people clearly lacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, working in a group certainly has an advantage. Such as being able to get the opinion of several people and then working out the best way to do a certain task. On the other hand, being able to just focus on the problem, without other people possibly interrupting your thought is way more appealing for me. And I think this is what most other introverts will think too. I don’t want to say that this “superior” in some way, I just think that when you get thrown into an unknown situation, it’s easier to work with that situation when you know how to handle things. And since we’re talking about school and university here, the situation you get thrown in when you come from secondary school to university is that you have to learn things yourself. It’s not like the professors don’t care how well you do at all, no (at least that’s what it’s like here). But they certainly care less than the teachers in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to a close, I certainly don’t want to say that “Hey, introverts are so much better at this!”. However, I do believe that to some extend people should be a bit more introvert at times. I mean sure, everyone thinks differently and might not be able to figure things out as well as I did for me, but hey, you might as well try. And given how much easier it felt for me when coming to university, I think it’s definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>GTA 5 Getting Pulled From the Shelves in Australia</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;– Disclaimer
There are a lot of posts about this on the internet already, spanning from well written ones to ones that try to defend the opinion with empty statements. This will be nothing more than a rant about what some peoples opinions are and generally my own one on the topic. You are free to agree and/or disagree with me or even critizise me in this regard, but be warned that I won’t get into a discussion with you in anyway about this topic. It is possible that I might bring up the same argument as other people, but that’s just the nature of rants. Also, this may contain mature content and heavy outrage, so take this into consideration before reading on.  &lt;br /&gt;
– Disclaimer end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I have to replay the situation again, because, as I have mentioned, there are enough articles out there already for this topic. So what is my take on it? I haven’t played this game in particular, but I have played previous games from the same series so I know what the game is about, but I can’t tell you anything about the exact storyline in this instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this short for you, here’s my standpoint: It is completely fine for Target to remove a product from their shelves, but the reason why is completely and utterly, sorry, bullshit. I’m not saying that Target should not listen to a petition made by alleged customers, because that would be wrong as well. However, the point where I think it is wrong is that the people who made the petition (also including those who signed it) either have a bad attitude towards games in general and thus come from a way too subjective standpoint or don’t really understand how things work in games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because all I see in the petition and blog posts who support this opinion is always focused around the idea that you can “murder” prostitues to gain benefits (thus encouraging you to do so) and that they’re portrayed as victims. There’s more to it, but that’s the gist I read from those posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are they? I have yet to see an actual reference or citation for this where you can “murder” a prostitute (after you had sexual intercourse with her) IN A SPECIAL WAY. This is key: “special way”. Yes, you can kill them. But there are two things that are bound into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you can only kill them the same way you can kill any other NPC in the game, thus not treating them any different from literally ANYONE ELSE in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, who tells you to kill them? The game itself doesn’t. I have yet to see an instruction in the game where it says that you should kill prostitues after you had sex with them. You have the option, yes, but the decision is on your behalf and if you feel like you should do it, then the blame is on you, not the game. The game simply allows this because it allowed you to kill everyone else, which you seem to be ok with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see why the equality here would be anything but the right thing. In fact, everwhere else people want equality, now they get what they want and then it’s still wrong? I don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets get to how they are depicted in the game and also compare it to how society outside of the virtual world is depciting them. Do you see a difference? I don’t feel like they are depicted any differently in the game than in the “real life” society and I would blame the society here, not the game. Because the game just imitates the society we live in (and from what I’ve seen so far, I think it does that pretty well). So blaming the game is like criticising the result and not the underlying issue, which you should do instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find more disturbing is that the petition claims that you can do things which are -BY LAW- not even allowed to be in a game that is getting sold in Australia. If those things would be in the game, the game would be indexed and not be allowed to be distributed to customers in the first place. Also, the game is already rated as 18+, which should tell you that the game may contain a lot of violence, sex and other such things. This is quite obviously saying: “If you can’t handle this, don’t play it, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED”. If you still buy it and play it, it is, again, your own choice. If you go to a museum and look at a picture which displays the idea of burning women just because other people claim they’re “whitches” it’s fine as well right? Just because it’s a videogame where you can interact with the environment yourself it is any different? HA, no. Unless the game forces you to do those things, which it obviously does not. So it’s still all your own decisions and if you chose to do certain things, the only one to blame is yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last point I want to raise here is the fact that we’re talking about a virtual world, a world that does not reflect back into our world and is completely made up. It might show similarities to our world, but that doesn’t mean you have to take them that way. If you cannot distinguish between the virtual and real world, I’m sorry, but then there is something wrong with you. If you let yourself get influenced by a game in such a way, then I would be really worried about your general reasoning abilities. Because I’m pretty sure, books can have the same effect, yet maybe to a lesser extend, yet nobody is worrying about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lets go over to the response from the Take-Two CEO because his main point is what I find a really good response. “It’s one thing for someone to not want to buy a piece of content, which is completely understandable. […] And that’s really the solution. If you don’t like it and it’s offensive to you, then you don’t buy it.” I think this is not only a good response but the solution to the problem. If you don’t like a game, why would you bother buying it? If a game is bad or horrible and people won’t buy it, it already tells the developer/publisher enough about the product they made. There’s no reason to overreact and also shout in their face that they should feel bad. “Are you telling me to ignore the ‘issue’ at hand?” By now, it should be pretty clear that I would not consider GTA 5 to be any kind of issue contrary to what the people wanted to express with the petition. This is not like a law that was forced upon you and thus making the situation completely different, it was made an issue because you chose to make it an issue of yours even though you had the choice to not be affected by it. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Is This?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is, as you might’ve noticed, something that looks like a blog, doesn’t it? Well, it is indeed some form of blog, but don’t expect it to have (continuously) new content on it. I tend to forget such things pretty easily and then I found something new and get rid of the old stuff… Which might be somewhat sad but I just like to try out all the new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I do in my daily life? And what would I put here? Um, nothing and everything seems like a bad but fitting answer. I kind of want to write more just to get better and used to it, so I might just rant about something that doesn’t make any sense to just feel like having done something. I might also just put up some results I found when working with some kind of framework that I tried out. Or you might even find a solution to an issue you have with X application that, for whatever reason, I also have and fixed. So basically, I don’t know what I, in the end, will put up here. I honestly don’t expect someone to read anything that I push up here, either because it is completely boring or generally badly written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have come this far, you are either actually interested or everything else is even more boring than this (which I would find pretty unusual), so why don’t I tell you something about myself? I’m currently in university on my way to a bachelors degree in applied computer science. I also work in this field for the rest of the time at a company here in Germany. Been generally interested in programming and computers as soon as I had my first own computer. It’s not like I ripped that thing apart as soon as I got it to see what kind of cool parts it had, but lets say I started slow. As probably every boy in my age (I’m 19 right now), I also tend to play video games every now and then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s enough around me for the time being I think. More will probably shine through when I actually write things on this blog thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
